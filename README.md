# Revenue_Forecasting
Python project on forecasting monthly revenues in of start-ups and scale-ups in B2B SaaS. As the utilized data is confidential, some parts of the code as well as outputs were excluded for the sake of this upload. I chose to compare models from the classes of SARIMA, NeuralProphet and Temporal Fusion Transformer.
